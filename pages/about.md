## Description of the course

This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the core concepts
and approaches for the analysis of biological data, particularly large data
sets. This is meant as a first, foundational course for graduate students. It
is advanced in that we will move through the material quickly with the goal of
covering all major topics in univariate data analysis, forming a foundation for
subsequent learning. Students will learn to use the powerful statistical
programming language R.
