## Course Description:

This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the core concepts
and approaches for the analysis of biological data, particularly large data
sets. This is meant as a first, foundational course for graduate students. It
is advanced in that we will move through the material quickly with the goal of
covering all major topics in univariate data analysis, forming a foundation for
subsequent learning. Students will learn to use the powerful statistical
programming language R.
